To change the makefile from running the 'mini' set to the 'full' set I simply changed the source from .../wk10/mini to .../wk10/full and renamed the file extensions to match those in the full folder (.fastq.gz->.fq.gz)
(I think this is all I needed to do for this assignment please let me know if I misinterpreted anything)
