## Transcriptomic Analysis: Generating Counts with Salmon

For this assignment, I used the makefile to run on the full directory using Salmon to quantify gene expression levels. This generated a merged file of counts, which I converted to a tsv to show the gene expression counts for each sample in the full directory.

```bash
cp merged.sf merged.tsv
```

The script/ make file and tsv are in the wk10 folder submission.
