## Week 4: Notes

### *This week we learned how to navigate vim, as well as git commands*

When scolling around move around mode or "normal mode" you can use these commands:
    gg : scroll up the file 
    G : scroll down the file 
    . : repeat last command 
    u : undo 
    CTRL + r : redo 

IF, you are in normal mode, and you want to go to insert mode you can just press "i". However there are other ways to go from normal to insert > more specifically. When in normal mode, instead of just using "i" for insert, you can also use the following commands:

i: insert/start typing where the curser currrently is
I: insert at the start of the line 
A: insert or "append" at the end of the line 
O: open a new line above
o: open a new line below
