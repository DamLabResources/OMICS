# Week 8: Learning Activity (Independent Session to Work on Project) 


### Summary Of Goals: 

1. Understand how ADA-1 overexpression in HA-CART cells changes gene extression at a transcript level using RNA seq data, previously published in the paper: https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy2.library.drexel.edu/science/article/pii/S1535610824000084?via%3Dihub#sec4 

2. The groups that will use are listed below: 

| Group # | Gene Edit         | Description                             |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Group 1 | HA-CART           | Control CART                           |
| Group 2 | ADAOE-CART        | CART with ADA-1 Overexpression         |


3. Create a reference genome using the human genome + CAR plasmid + ADA plasmid so that I can identify changes in transcript levels beyond those two edits (Will helping with this). 

4. Create a gff file for the reference genome that identitifes where the transcripts start and stop. (Will helping with this). 

5. Locate the following files and share with Will in order to make unique reference genome: 

    a. CAR Plasmid Fasta file 
       
    b. Genbank files for CAR
    
 
 
 6. Once these files are found send to Will.

 ## Steps Used to Make reference Genome
 
 
### 1. Find the RNA Seq Data from Paper: "Bulk RNAseq data from AAVS1KO, CD39KO, CD73KO, A2aR KO, ADA-OE HA-CAR T cells".
     https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy2.library.drexel.edu/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE250442
     
### 2. Locate the following files and share with Will in order to make unique reference genome: 

####    CAR Plasmid Fasta file

1. Klys paper that I am using cited that HA-CART were generated based on previously described in this paper:  https://www-nature-com.ezproxy2.library.drexel.edu/articles/s41586-019-1805-z
   
2. Cited Paper from the mutations that were introduced: https://aacrjournals.org/cancerimmunolres/article/3/2/125/467742/The-Nonsignaling-Extracellular-Spacer-Domain-of

3. Found the CAR Plasmids in this site, but still need to confirm which is the correct one to use:

4. Download snap gene

5. Insert the sequence from the gene and find the sequence for the CAR itself. do not need the viral vector to be included here. 

6. Find a FASTA file for CAR

7. Find gff for CAR

8. Send everything to Will. 

       
    a. ADA Plasmid Fasta file 
    
    b. genbank files for CAR plasmids

- After talking to WiLL, ALL I need is the sequence of the HA-CAR to add because the ADA-1 OE will align with the human ADA-1 gene. 

- I found it here: https://www.addgene.org/207506/sequences/

1. Download snapgene: https://www.addgene.org/207506/sequences/
