# Week 8: Learning Activity (Independent Session to Work on Project) 


### Summary Of Goals: 

1. Understand how ADA-1 overexpression in HA-CART cells changes gene extression at a transcript level using RNA seq data, previously published in the paper: https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy2.library.drexel.edu/science/article/pii/S1535610824000084?via%3Dihub#sec4 

2. The groups that will use are listed below: 

| Group # | Gene Edit         | Description                             |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Group 1 | HA-CART           | Control CART                           |
| Group 2 | ADAOE-CART        | CART with ADA-1 Overexpression         |


3. Create a reference genome using the human genome + CAR plasmid + ADA plasmid so that I can identify changes in transcript levels beyond those two edits (Will helping with this). 

4. Create a gff file for the reference genome that identitifes where the transcripts start and stop. (Will helping with this). 

5. Locate the following files and share with Will in order to make unique reference genome: 

    a. CAR Plasmid Fasta file 
       
    b. ADA Plasmid Fasta file 
    
    c. genbank files for CAR/ADA plasmids
 
 
 
 6. Once these files are found send to Will.
