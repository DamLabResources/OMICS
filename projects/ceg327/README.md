# This is the new README file where I describe my OMICS project

1. Introduction
This goal of this project is to analyze publicly available ATAC-seq datasets from models of HIV-1 latency for regions of chromatin accessibility across the integrated provirus. This information will be used to determine sites accessible for CRISPR gRNA targeting.
