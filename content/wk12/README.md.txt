# RNA Transcriptomics

This week we will explore analyzing data from an RNA-seq experiment.
To make next week's task easier, we are going to use a human transcriptomics experiment.

This dataset was generated by Dr. Jill Lawrence.
In it she applied extracellular Tat to microglia in different combinations and optionally with a stimulation.
After 4 or 6 days she extracted RNA for downstream processing.
I analyzed it with the `nfcore/rnaseq` pipeline.

Copy the provided Jupyter notebook to your own working directory and then follow along.
