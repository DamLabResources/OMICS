# Introduction to Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis (GOEA)

Given a list of differentially expressed genes between two conditions,
such as cancer and no cancer,
molecular biologists want to know the biological context of 
the up- or down-regulated genes between the two conditions.

Gene ontology enrichment analysis (GOEA) illuminates the biological functions
that differ between the genes expressed or repressed in the diseased state
versus the normal state.
